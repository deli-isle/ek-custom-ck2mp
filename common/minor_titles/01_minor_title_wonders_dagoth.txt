#Yes the allowed_to_grant restrictions are intentional.
#No, I'm not going to nerf or remove them. They're intentional.
#If they annoy you because you don't have "enough" candidates, it's intentional and WAD.
#The wonders are meant to be active only if you are actually using them, or have the appointed minor title.
