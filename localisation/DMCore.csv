DMCoreEvttitle16;Divine Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc16;"I've been doing some MORE science recently, and I have discovered that actually [religion_proven.GetName] is probably right!

DMCoreEvt16OptA;"My god... he's right.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt16OptB;"My god, he's gone completely mad...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt16OptC;"This is... interesting...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle17;Lost City of Gold Uncovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc17;Rumours have always persisted around [lost_province_of_gold.GetName] speaking of the lost city of gold, but many dismissed it as the dreams of a desperately poor people. The Dungeon Master, feeling a great pity for the people in [lost_city_of_gold.GetName] decided to make all of their dreams come true and transformed the whole city, including it's foundations, and natural resources, into solid gold!\nUnfortunately, the tricky caused by the Dungeon Master had an unintended side effect - people were randomly turning to gold and infecting others with the same curse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvt18OptA;"This doesn't sound suspicious in the least!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip18;Nine for Mortal Men...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle19;Blessing in Disguise...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc19;"I've been doing a bit of poking around and at the bottom of a lake I found a age-old container filled to the brim with religious texts! I have no idea who put those there but, in my usually helpful nature, I've decided to forward a copy to the relevant religious heads so they can study and make the changes that their religion must have conveniently forgotten about!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt19OptA;"We have to do WHAT now?!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip19;Random religions randomly gain random alterations from a random list.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle20;Realm fit for a King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc20;"Maybe I've been looking at it all wrong..." says the Dungeon Master, stroking his beard, "You sick people. You actually ENJOY this don't you? This is all game to you isn't it. Unbelievable. Well, I know exactly what will solve that problem!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle21;Perfectly Normal Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc21;"What is WRONG with you people!?" screams the Dungeon Master, "Look at this person, this person RIGHT HERE" he says, gesturing to a perfectly normal person standing in your court.

Believing it to be a divine gift, the local ruler of the province bathed in the waters and drank deeply, only to discover that their strength grew rapidly and the ravages of time seemed to be reversed!\nThe local holy man has declared the site as sacred, with only the blessed ruler being allowed entrance into the divine fountain.

"See Gary has always dreamt big, but he never quite made it, so I'm going to let him live vicariously! Every court throughout the land will get their very own Gary, fruit directly from the loin's of Gary Prime!"\nSuddenly a nefarious looking copy of Gary pops into your court, "Buuuut..." continues the Dungeon Master, "These Gary's will be slightly amped up. Much more ambitious and skilled than the original, so watch your back!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt23OptA;"Erm... welcome... Gary?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip23;Gary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle24;Friends in High Places;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle29;Stroke of Genius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc29;"It's always the same with you people" begins a very judgemental Dungeon Master, "It's always genius, strong, fair, claims, whatever with you people, never what's on the INSIDE. And that's all that counts. Well, in hindsight, I guess genius is on the inside, now that I think about it... and claims too... Well don't think you're getting away with it that easily!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt29OptA;"You seem... different?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip29;Everyone becomes Genius...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvt30OptA;"I was born in September!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip30A;I am throwing the dice, let's see what you get..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle31;Marks and Angels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc31;"So I've been reading some of the works of some fine lads called Charles Marks and Fred Angels," the Dungeon Master says, looking up from a little red book. "Their ideas of wealth redistrubution has given me an idea...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt31OptA;"Uh oh.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt31OptB;"NO, MY PRECIOUS MONEY!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt31OptC;"Oh, this benefits me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip31;All playable rulers will have their wealth taken from them and redistributed evenly. As a side note, the Dungeon Master doesn't know what 'redistributed' means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc32;"Do you like chess?" the Dungeon Master asks with a wide, sinister grin on his face. "I do! In fact, I love it so much that I've invited a friend over to play with me. I forgot to bring the chess pieces, but no matter! We'll be using you lot!"\nThe Dungeon Master scratches his chin in thought and smirks. "So, tell me, what colour do you like?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle32;The Chessboard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt32OptA;"I like all colours!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt32OptB;"Uhh... white?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvt32Tooltip;Two random rulers will become the White Queen and the Black Queen, and all other rulers around them will be their tributaries. The tributaries on the losing side will suffer dire consequences for their failure. Knight to King 4.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc33;"I simply adore animals!" exclaims the Dungeon Master while playing around with a kitten, making it chase a peacock feather. "The tiny ones, the big ones, the ones with sharp teeth that will eviscerate you in a moments notice..." He looks up at you and smirks wildly. "Would you like your own pet? Only 50 coins, and it can be yours! And I promise it wont die!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle33;Pet Shop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt33OptA;"Sure, I'll buy one!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt33OptB;"Eh, another time, perhaps.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt33OptC;"But you already sold me one before...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt33TooltipA;A randomly-chosen pet will appear on your character screen as a character modifier. All are permanent and beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt33TooltipB;All rulers will be given the option to buy a pet of their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc34;"I've recently come across seven strange men," the Dungeon Master quips. "They are a quirky bunch, all of them are dwarves, singing while they work in the salt mines. But they do seem lonely. They have expressed their desire to join the court of a delightfully-female ruler. Don't ask me how delightfully-female is different from regular female.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle34;Snow White;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt34OptA;"Seven dwarves? What is this, a fairy tale?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip34;One playable female ruler in the world will receive a gift of seven dwarves of varying usefulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc35;"Family is the most important thing in the world," quips the Dungeon Master while stroking his chin. "But you also know what's just as important? Congenital traits and bloodlines. Trying to get them is such a hassle, so I'm going to be nice and let you kidnap any one child of your choosing."\nThe Dungeon Master lifts up a finger to silence your forthcoming questions, "There are stipulations, however. No rulers, no AI heirs, and no heirs of players unless they have a spare. Don't say I didn't do anything nice for you!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle35;Kidnapping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt35OptA;"Only one?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip35;You are given a single-use targeted decision against any child within diplomatic range. This child will move to your court and join your dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip35Safe;nobody finding out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip35Caught;the prior liege of the child is notified;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc36;"Humility is a weird concept," muses the Dungeon Master as he surveys the land. "I prefer fear when keeping people in line. Oh, and speaking of fear and humility..." The Dungeon Master grins from ear to ear and snaps his fingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle36;Vassal/Liege Swap;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt36OptA;"Wha...?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip36;A random independent ruler and one of their vassals will trade titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc37;\n\nEverything is eerily silent. The leaves do not rustle in the wind, the birds are quiet, even your own footsteps as you walk into the forest grove are muted.\nBefore you is a woman with pale skin and raven black hair, dressed only in a robe that matches her hair color. The scythe she wields gives you no doubt as to her identity.\n\n"Be not afraid, mortal," she speaks, nary an emotion crosses her lips, "you are fast asleep in the real world. I have come to offer you a deal." She extends a hand out, waiting for you to take it into yours. "I will grant you a longer lifespan, but in return you will die on a specific date."\n\nDeath is offering you a choice to live another 10 years as an exceptional [GetManWoman], 25 years as you are, or 50 as an inferior [GetManWoman]. But at the end of those years, Death will come back to claim you. This also does not prevent your death from the sword or the dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle37;To Dream of Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt37OptA;"10 years.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip37A;Choose to live another 10 years in glory. After 10 years, you will die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMEventTooltip37C;Choose to live another 50 years in mediocrity. After 50 years, you will die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt37OptD;"I refuse your deal.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip37D;You wake up in bed. Was it just a dream, or was it real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc3701;You find yourself back in the familiar forest grove, lit only by the full moon. "It is time, mortal," speaks the pale reaper. "Your time on this mortal world has come to an end.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle3701;To Dream of Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt3701OptA;It's a sad thing that your adventures have ended here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc38;"People tell me I'm not kind," muses the Dungeon Master. "Well, I'll show them! BEHOLD! I shall grant a fourth of the populace the power of my dragon!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle38;Blood of the Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt38OptA;"Your dragon?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip38A;Every playable ruler will have a 25% chance of getting a non-inheritable bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvtdesc39;The DM appears before you with an animal cage in hand, looking worried. "I, uh..." he fidgets, "may have accidentally loosed some animals into the world. And given them sentience. And titles. Whoops.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvttitle39;Animal Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvt39OptA;"What do you mean, 'whoops'?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMEventTooltip39A;An animal kingdom has appeared on the map.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle40;The Network;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc40NoTower;"5G!" the Dungeon Master exclaims happily. "Such a wonderful technology! It was given to me by the Lizard People, and will prooooo-" he stops to clear his throat before continuing, "...prove to be a real game changer.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc40TTANoTower;"Five... gee...? What?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc40;While walking through your demense one day, you come across the damnest sight: a herd of cows- all dressed like human laborers- building a giant metal tower of some kind. You suspect it's time to take up drinking as a hobbby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle41;For Whom The Horn Doots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc41;No man is an island, entire of itself. Each is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less. As well as if a promontory were. As well as if a manor of thine own or of thine friend's were. Each man's death diminishes me, for I am involved in mankind. Therefore, send not to know for whom the horn doots, It doots for thee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc41TTA;"Thank you, Mr Skeltal.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc41TTACustom;You are granted a one-time useage of the Horn of Dootage during battle. From peasants to emperors, all tremble at the sound of the mighty doot doot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle42;Eternity Battle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc42;The Dungeon Master suddenly appears in front of you looking exasperated and almost... scared? "Listen, these are your problem now," he begins, as he opens his hand revealing six bright stones of various colours, "Fight, bribe, kill each other over them - I don't care." He begins to run out of the room, but suddenly snaps back to face you. "Just don't let HIM get them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc42TTA;"All of that over brightly coloured rocks?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc42TTACustom;The ßBEternity Pebblesß! are now active in the world and have been randomly distributed to six rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreEvttitle43;Rabid Dog!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc43;Lately, your dog has been acting strangely. It has become overly violent and refuses to drink water. Just as you were taking it out for a morning stroll, the damned thing bit you! You can see the dog foaming at the mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc43TTA;"Oh no, this can't be good!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc43NoDog;The Dungeon Master bursts into the room wearing various furs, including a canine headdress that would look more at home on a shaman. "Can I nuzzle wuzzle you? uwu you're so warm!" he says, playfully batting at you with his fake wolf paws. He suddenly sees a cat and starts chasing after it. "SNUGGLE WUGGLE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreEvtdesc43TTB;"What.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowdesc12;[dead_heir.GetHerHisCap] body has been draped, by whom you do not know, in a white cloth now stained red by [dead_heir.GetHerHis] lost vitae. They say [dead_heir.GetSheHe] was found by [dead_heir.GetHerHis] horse, in a clearing in the woods. You know the place they speak of. [dead_heir.GetHerHisCap] face is calm, almost serene. You reach out to touch [dead_heir.GetHerHim]. The terrible reality of the situation dawns on you. The cold you feel is that of death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollow23TTACustomTT;The 5G tower explodes in a burst of energy, leaving behind a new and frightening disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle24;The Whispers in your Mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowdesc24;Your cursed ring has imbued you with all sorts of power, and through it you have achieved great feats of glory. But some days a great whisper rattles in your skull and its lure is almost too difficult to resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow24a;"I... I am strong enough!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow24b;"I submit! No more, please!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle28;Fading Whispers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowdesc28;Having suffered the constant dark words in your mind for too long you grab at your finger and yank the ring from it with all of your might. Though it grips to your skin at first, eventually the ring relents, and with a solid thud, it hits the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow28OptA;I will put this away, but perhaps not too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowTooltip28;You successfully remove the ring, though you could wear it again at any time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DMCoreFollowtitle29;Darkness Binds Them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowdesc29;In a mad fit of desperation you take hold of the cursed ring that sits on your finger and try to pull it off with all of your strength. Thought you try with all your might, you find yourself thinking... it is your ring. Afterall, why shouldn't you keep it? It has already gotten you so far!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollow29OptA;Silly me, what was I thinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DMCoreFollowTooltip29;Characters with more morally good traits, and self-control, will have a higher chance of the resisting the ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
